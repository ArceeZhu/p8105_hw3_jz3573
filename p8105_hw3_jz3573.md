# Question 2

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## ── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──

    ## ℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors

``` r
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(p8105.datasets)
```

## clean the data

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010")
cleaned_brfss_smart2010 <-brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(
    topic=="Overall Health" & response %in% c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor")) %>% 
  mutate(
    response= factor(response, levels=c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very Good", "Excellent"), ordered = TRUE)
  )
```

如何改正这里，让order能出现？

## In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What about in 2010?

``` r
location_count_2002<-cleaned_brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  filter(year==2002) %>% 
  group_by(locationabbr) %>% 
  summarise(location_count=n_distinct(locationdesc)) %>% 
  filter(location_count>=7)
```

In 2002, CT,FL,MA,NC,NJ,PA,total of 6 states, were observed in 7 or more
locations.

``` r
location_count_2010<-cleaned_brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  filter(year==2010) %>% 
  group_by(locationabbr) %>% 
  summarise(location_count=n_distinct(locationdesc)) %>% 
  filter(location_count>=7)
```

In 2010, CA,CO,FL,MA, MD,NC,NE,NJ,NY,OH,PA,SC,TX,WA , total of 14 states
, were observed in 14 or more locations.

## Construct a dataset and create a spaghetti figure

``` r
excellent_df <- cleaned_brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  filter (response == "Excellent") %>% 
  group_by(locationabbr, year) %>%
  summarise (avg_data_value=mean(data_value)) 
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'locationabbr'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

``` r
plot_spaghetti=ggplot(excellent_df, aes(x=year, y=avg_data_value,group=locationabbr,color=locationabbr))+geom_line()
```

## create a dataset and then a two-panel figure

``` r
ny_df <- cleaned_brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  filter (locationabbr=="NY" &  year %in% c(2006,2010) &  response %in% c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very Good", "Excellent"))
```

``` r
ggplot(ny_df,aes (x=response, y=data_value, color=locationdesc)) +geom_point()+theme_minimal()+ facet_grid(year ~ .)
```

# Question 3

## Load,tidy, merge and organize the data sets.

### load the dataset

``` r
demo <- read.csv("./data/nhanes_covar.csv",skip = 4) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(age>=21) %>% 
  drop_na()
```

``` r
acce <- read.csv("./data/nhanes_accel.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na()
```

### merge the datasets

``` r
merged=full_join(demo,acce,by="seqn") %>% 
  mutate(education=case_when(
    education==1~ "less than high school",
    education==2~ "high school equivalent",
    education==3~ "more than high school"
  ),
  sex=case_when(
    sex==1 ~ "male",
    sex==2 ~ "female"
  )) %>% 
  drop_na()
```

## Produce a reader-friendly table for the number of men and women in each education category

``` r
gen_edu<-merged %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  group_by(sex,education) %>% 
  summarize(count=n(),.groups = "drop") %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = education, values_from = count) 
```

``` r
knitr::kable(gen_edu, caption =  "Number of Men and Women in each Education Category", format = "markdown")
```

| sex    | high school equivalent | less than high school | more than high school |
|:-------|-----------------------:|----------------------:|----------------------:|
| female |                     23 |                    28 |                    59 |
| male   |                     35 |                    27 |                    56 |

Number of Men and Women in each Education Category

## create a histgram of the age distributions for men and women in each education category.

``` r
age_sex_edu_plot <- merged %>% 
ggplot(aes(x=age,fill=sex)) + geom_histogram()+
  facet_grid(sex~education) +
  labs(title = "Age Distributions by Gender and Education Category", x = "Age", y = "Count")

age_sex_edu_plot
```

    ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

![](p8105_hw3_jz3573_files/figure-gfm/create%20a%20histgram-1.png)<!-- -->
The table illustrates the distribution of the sex and gender
distribution on education. Aaccoding to the graph, “more than high
school” has the most people in both gender. Woman and man in 20 to 40
are most likely to receive ” higher than high school” educaiton than
other age group.
